# Getting the Most out of the Inform 7 Windows IDE using NonVisual Desktop Access

## Purpose of this Document

This document exists to familiarize an Inform 7 author with the form and functions of David Kinder's Windows interface, and recommendations of how these can best be accessed with a screenreader. This document primarily focuses on using the program with NonVisual Desktop Access (herein "NVDA"), though some of these techniques have equivalents in other screenreaders, and applying those equivalents may have positive results.

### Method

This documentation is split into two sections.

The first discusses the ease of access to the functions of the modern Inform 7 IDE. In this case, "ease" refers not to a user's proficiency with either their screenreader or Inform 7, but the relative accessibility of those functions to NVDA's built-in services.

Most users reasonably familiar with NVDA already have the skills necessary to use Inform 7 with it. For all but the story tab, standard editing and page navigation commands are all you will need. To use the story tab, you will need to know the basics of object navigation.

The second section is less organized: It contains specific information on how to work around accessibility bugs in Inform 7 to acomplish certain tasks. It is only descriptive, and is not intended as a discussion of best practice. In other words, if you find a better way, do that instead. And please share it with us!

If you are interested in the workings of the Inform 7 Windows IDE, [its sourcecode is here](https://github.com/DavidKinder/Windows-Inform7).

I'm providing this link in good faith, and not as a dig at David Kinder. He has worked and does work hard on the software, and I don't believe its present state of accessibility to be a result of any malice on his part. That said, I will not spend any time apologizing for its present state either. Problems with accessibility are [bugs][1] by definition, and anyone's wanting them fixed is not personal.
